# Function Overloading

---

* Many times, we will need to write a function that can have **multiple** definitions. 
* Recall that we can write multiple constructors, a **default** constructor, and constructor that accepts arguments. This is an example of **function overloading.**
* When using a function that has multiple definitions, the compiler will find the function with the argument list that matches the types of the argument that you passed to it. This is called **argument resolution.**
* Functions can have multiple definitions by having differing argument lists.
* You cannot overload functions by changing the return type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Foo {
public:
    void print(int i) {
        std::cout << "Pring int: " << i << std::endl;
    }

    void print(double f) {
        std::cout << "Print double: " << f << std::endl;
    }

    void print(char c) {
        std::cout << "Print char: " << c << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Foo foo;
    foo.print(5);
    foo.print(2.71727);
    foo.print('J');

    return 0;
}
```
