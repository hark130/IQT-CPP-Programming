# Namespaces

---

* Recall the topic of scope and local variables from C
* As C++ libraries begin to grow, name collisions could occur as your program could include multiple entities that define the same name.
* keyword namespace gives a new level of scope, so entities can be defined to a scope.
* **::** is the scope resolution operator, so you can reference a variable or function in a particular scope.
* keyword **using** allows your program to use an entire namespace.

```cpp
//bas.h
namespace IQTCPP {
    int foo;
    class bar;
    void bas();
}
```

```cpp
//some_other_file.cpp
using namespace IQTCPP;
using namespace IQTCPP::bas;

void do_stuff() {
    foo = 10;
    bar x;
    IQTCPP::bas();
}
â€¦
```

### using namespace std == BAD PRACTICE

```cpp
using namespace std; // BAD PRACTICE
```

We will go over this more to come. But to keep it short, the **std** namespace is where the C++ built in library routines are kept. This is the "standard" namespace. By "using" the entire standard namespace... we could run into a lot of collisions.
