# Object Composition

### Problems with Inheritance

* Do we really need this long inheritance chain? Could we redesign this?

```cpp
// Stub code... not meant to compile

class Vehicle {};

class Car: public Vehicle {};
class Motorcycle: public Vehicle {};

class SportsCar: public Car {};
class Truck: public Car {};
class SportBike: public Motorcycle {};

class Ferrari: public SportsCar {};
class Slingshot: public SportsCar, public SportBike {}; // Multiple inheritance
```

* Out of control inheritance can lead to ambiguity
* C++ allows for **multiple inheritance**, which leads to the ***diamond problem***
* Suppose A has a function **overridden** by B and C, but not by D
* If I call the function in D... which parent classes version of the function is called?
* Take care when designing classes to avoid this... but let's just try and avoid abusing inheritance all together.

## Object Composition

* An object is composed of several smaller parts, an object "Has-A" other object \(I.E. A car has a steering wheel\)
* Object composition allows us to combine many smaller, simpler parts together. We can reuse code in many places without the complexities of inheritance. 
* Classes are instead focused on smaller, more specific tasks. 

#### Let's take a look at an example...

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>


class Engine {
public:
    Engine(int d, int c, bool f) {
        displacement = d;
        cylinders = c;
        fuelInjected = f;
    }
    void printEngine() {
        std::cout << "==Engine Specs==" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Displacement: " << displacement << "cc" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Cylinders: " << cylinders << std::endl;
        if (fuelInjected == 1) {
            std::cout << "Fuel Injected: True" << std::endl;
        }
        else {
            std::cout << "Fuel Injected: False" << std::endl;
        }
    }
private:
    int displacement;
    int cylinders;
    bool fuelInjected;
};

class Interior {
public:
    Interior(std::string c, std::string m, int ns) {
        color = c;
        material = m;
        numberOfSeats = ns;
    }
    void printInterior() {
        std::cout << "==Interior Specs==" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Color: " << color << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Material: " << material << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Number of seats: " << numberOfSeats << std::endl;
    }
private:
    std::string(color);
    std::string(material);
    int numberOfSeats;
};

// More Specific
class Motorcycle {
public:
    Motorcycle(std::string mname, Engine mMotorcycleEngine)
    :motorcycleName(mname),
    motorcycleEngine(mMotorcycleEngine){

    }
    void printInfo() {
        std::cout << "Model: " << motorcycleName << std::endl;
        motorcycleEngine.printEngine();
    }
private:
    std::string(motorcycleName);
    Engine motorcycleEngine;
};


class Car {
public:
    Car(std::string cname, Engine ccarEngine, Interior ccarInterior) 
    :carName(cname),
    carEngine(ccarEngine),
    carInterior(ccarInterior){

    }
    void printInfo() {
        std::cout << "Model: " << carName << std::endl;
        carEngine.printEngine();
        carInterior.printInterior();
    }
private:
    std::string carName;
    Engine carEngine;
    Interior carInterior;
};

int main() {
    // Let's create two engines
    Engine engine1(4000, 6, true); // 991 varient engine
    Engine engine2(1811, 2, true); // Indian bagger varient engine

    // Then we will create one interior... since we don't need one for the motorcycle we are going to create
    Interior interior1("black", "leather", 2); // 991 varient interior

    // Now lets creat the cars and motorcylces
    Car car1("Porshe 911 R", engine1, interior1); // Porsehe 911 R (991 varient)
    Motorcycle mc1("Indian Chieftain Limited", engine2);


    std::cout << "Let's take a look at the our first car..." << std::endl;
    car1.printInfo();

    std::cout << "\n\n\n" << "Now let's take a look at the first motorcycle..." << std::endl;
    mc1.printInfo();


    return 0;

}
```
