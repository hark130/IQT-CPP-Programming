# Object Lifecycle

---

One of the most powerful aspects of C++ is the **object lifecycle model. **This refers to when an object is **instantiated**, and when the object's resources are **released.**

* In C/C++, this CyberBullet is put in the stack frame of fn\(\) here:

```cpp
void fn() {
    CyberBullet cb;
}
```

CyberBullet is allocated on function call and deallocated when the function returns. Just like virtually everything else on the stack.

* We can also put it on the heap:

```cpp
// C-Style (what you are used to seeing)
CyberBullet *a (CyberBullet*) malloc(sizeof(CyberBullet));

// C++ Style
auto a = new CyberBullet();
```

* Recall that in C, malloc\(\) returns allocated memory of a given size from the heap in a pointer.
* In C++, this object is **constructed **with a **constructor, **specifically... CyberBullet's constructor.
* The constructor is called with the **new **operator and must be paired with a delete operator. Why?

---

## Constructors

* Constructors are special member functions that initialize objects. 
* They do not have ANY return type
* A class can have many different constructors, each with a unique argument list.
* An object begins its life with a call to a constructor
* The **this **keyword is a pointer used to refer to the **instance **of the class being called.

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class CyberMissile{
    double range, warhead; // These are private by default 
public:
    // Constructor
    CyberMissile(double range, double warhead) {
        this->range = range;
        this->warhead = warhead;
    }
    void fire();
};

void CyberMissile::fire() {
    std::cout << "Range: " << range << " || Warhead: " << warhead << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    CyberMissile Mis1(400.50, 10.00);
    Mis1.fire();

}

// Outputs
// Range: 400.5 || Warhead: 10
```

* Member objects are constructed before an owning object is constructed.

#### Example 2:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class CyberEngine {
public:
    CyberEngine() {
    printf("Engine is ready!");
    }
};

int main() {
    CyberEngine jet;

    return 0;
}

// Outputs
// Engine is ready!
```

#### Example 3:

Multiple Constructors

* We are using a concept called **overloading**
* Class constructors can be overloaded
* As long as the parameters differ in some way, we can have two functions with the same name. aka two constructors. 
* We can also use **default constructors **by setting the data in the constructors by hand. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Date {
private:
    int month, day, year;
    
public:
    Date(int m, int y) {
        month = m;
        day = 0;
        year = y;
    }
    
    Date (int m, int d, int y) {
        month = m;
        day = d;
        year = y;
    }
    
};

int main() {
    Date today(2,27,2018);
    Date thisMonth(2,2018);
    
    return 0;
}
    
```

---

## List Initialization

* There are still more ways to construct C++ objects.
* You can use **list initialization **with braces rather than parenthesis when calling the constructor.

```cpp
CyberMissile missile1 {100, 50};
CyberMissile missile2 {100, 50};
auto missile3 = CyberMissile{100, 50};
```

* List initialization can help protect you from **narrowing conversions... **in other words, data loss from fitting a larger variable into a smaller variable. \(Data originally stored with more bytes being stored into a type with less bytes\)
* This is a new feature from **C++11**... brace initialization naturally ensures narrowing of conversions.
* Be careful when your user defined data type accepts std::initializer\_list as a constructor parameter. Do not use list initialization in this case. \(e.g. std::vector\). Compiler will more than likely throw an error. 

---

## Narrowing Conversions

```cpp
void fun(double val, int val2) {

    int x2 = val;    // if val == 7.9, x2 becomes 7 (bad)
    char c2 = val2;  // if val2 == 1025, c2 becomes 1 (bad)

    int x3 {val};    // error: possible truncation (good)
    char c3 {val2};  // error: possible narrowing (good)
    char c4 {24}     // ok: 24 can be represented exactly as a char

    char c5 {264};   // error: (assuming 8-bit chars): 264 cannot be represented 
                     // as a char (good)

     int x4 {2.0}    // error: no double to int value conversion {good}
```

In other words, the {} will throw errors when we lose data. This is a good thing. We can catch this later and act on it if need be. **More to come**

## Destructors

* Destructors are special member functions that are called when an object's lifetime ends
* Recall: Member objects are constructed before an owning object is constructed. Destructors are applied in reverse order.
* The purpose of the destructor is to release resources that the object is responsible for.
* Like constructors, destructors have no return type. They are instead preceded by the ~
* Classes are allowed only one destructor
* Destructors are amazing, and you should use them. And love them. And make shrines to their amazingness. 

#### Example:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>


class File {
public:
    File(const char *file_name, const char *mode) {
        raw_file = fopen(file_name, mode);
    }
    // Deconstructor
    ~File() {
        fclose(raw_file);
    }
    void write(const char *input) {
        fprintf(raw_file, "%s", input);
    }
private:
    FILE * raw_file;
};



int main()
{
    File x("foo", "w+");
    x.write("Hello, world!");

    return 0;

}
```

#### Let's deconstruct what's going on:

```cpp
int main() {

    File x("foo", "w+");

    // Do stuffs

    if (something_bad_happend)
        return ERROR

    // Do more stuffs

    return SUCCESS;
}
```

* What happened to the File object upon return?

### Who Needs Garbage Collection?

> Garbage collection is neither necessary nor sufficient for quality software

-Bjarne Stroustrup, Herb Sutter, and Gabriel Dos Reis

> If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution
