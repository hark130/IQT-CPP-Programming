# Classes

---

### What are Classes?

**Classes** are user-defined types. They are very similar to **structs.** As we said previously, classes are like the blueprint for objects.

Classes:

* Classes consist of a set of **data members** \(variables, constants and functions\). 
* Classes can have some important functions for purposes:
  * Object initialization
  * Copy
  * Move
  * Object Destruction
* Members are accessed with the **.** operator for objects, and **-&gt;** for pointers. 
* Operators like **+, !, and \[\]** can be defined for a class.
* Classes are defined by the keyword **class**, which is like a **namespace** for its **members**.

#### Example:

```cpp
// Class
class CyberBullet {
    double velocity, position;
    double time_to_target_at(double target position) {
        return (target_position - position) / velocity;
    }
};
```

### Class vs Struct

As we said above, classes are similar to structs... very similar. But there are some differences.

* **Class members** are private by default
* **Struct members** are public by default
* This is their biggest difference

* Syntactically, they are very similar.

```cpp
// Struct
struct CyberBullet {
    double velocity, position;
    double time_to_target_at(double target_position) {
        return (target_position - position) / velocity;
    }
};


// Class
class CyberBullet {
    double velocity, position;
    double time_to_target_at(double target position) {
        return (target_position - position) / velocity;
    }
};
```
### Creation and Keywords

* Classes are defined just like structs
* This can be at the top of a file or in a header file
	* It is preferred you create your classes in header files
* We declare an object by creating an instance of the class
	* **Class** = A blueprint for an object in a sense
	* **Object** = The byproduct of a class (a copy of it, with itâ€™s own unique abilities)
	* **Instance** = Refers to the variable that holds the memory address of an object


## Creating a Class Instance -- 50,000 Feet

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Class
class CyberBullet {
public:
    void set_values(double, double);
    double time_to_target_at(double target_position) {
        return (target_position - position) / velocity;
    }
private:
    double velocity, position;
};


// Access via scope resolution operator
void CyberBullet::set_values(double x, double y) {
    velocity = x;
    position = y;
}

int main() {
    CyberBullet Cb; // Create an instance of CyberBullet
    Cb.set_values(50.00, 20.00);
    // Access time_to_target_at via . operator
    std::cout << "Time to target: " << Cb.time_to_target_at(100.00) << " minutes" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
