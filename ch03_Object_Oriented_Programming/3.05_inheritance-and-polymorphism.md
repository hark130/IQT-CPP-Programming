# Inheritance and Polymorphism

---

* The strength of objects is the ability to group together data and functionality into a logical design.
* The ability to relate objects together further assists in abstracting a complex problem.
* We can form hierarchies of classes, and we have two paradigms:
  * **Interface inheritance**: provides a contract that your code must comply to, both implementer and user. 
  * **Implementation inheritance:** simply implementation by deriving a class from another.

* C++ inheritance can be complicated...
* Conceptualize as an **Is-A relationship** \(IE. An eagle is a bird\)
* Classes can be extended to create a **derived class** which retains some characteristics of the **base class.**
* The **derived class** inherits the member functions and properties of the **base class.**
* **Polymorphism,** \(Latin: multiple-form\), use one class as though it were another.

### Let's take a look at an example...

* **Polygon** is our **base class**
* **Rectangle** and **Triangle** derive from **Polygon**
* The derived class inherits from the base class buy using the **:** operator during class declaration
* Only member variables and functions marked **public** or **protected** can be inherited
* **Rectangle** and **Triangle** can now access the data members declared in the **Polygon** class. 
* Notice too that both **Rectangle** and **Triangle** define a function **int area\(\),** with different implementations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Polygon {
protected:
    int width, height;
public:
    void set_values(int a = 0, int b = 0) {
        width = a; height = b;
    }
};


class Rectangle : public Polygon {
public:
    int area() {
        return width * height;
    }
};


class Triangle : public Polygon {
public:
    int area() {
        return width * height / 2;
    }
};


int main() {
    // Let's build a rectangle class first
    Rectangle picture_frame;
    // Then let's set values
    picture_frame.set_values(10, 15);       
    // Finally let's get the area of the picture frame (rectangle object)
    std::cout << "Area of picture frame is: " << picture_frame.area() << std::endl; 



    // Now let's build a Triangle object
    Triangle yield_sign;
    // Let's set yield_signs values
    yield_sign.set_values(10, 15);
    // Finally let's get the area of the picture frame (Triangle object) and print it out
    std::cout << "Area of the yield sign is: " << yield_sign.area() << std::endl;


    return 0;
}
```

### Inheritance Design

* To reiterate, inheritance allows a derived class to take on properties of its parent class. 
* We use inheritance to make a derived class that is more specific and tailored to our purpose \(I.E. - an eagle is more specific than a bird\)
* A function may exist in a parent class, that we need to use... but it isn't exactly what we need
* **Real world example:**
  * A bird flaps it's wings in order to fly
  * But an eagle flaps less and uses convection currents to soar
  * And a hummingbird flaps it's wings extremely fast in order to fly
* They are all birds, and they all **fly\(\)** but the implementation details will differ...
