> Luckily... not those type of containers.

**Containers** are used to manage collections, each container has its own advantages and disadvantages.

**Three categories of containers:**

* **Sequence Containers** – ordered collections in which every element has a position.
* **Associative Containers** – sorted collections in which the position of an element depends on its value due to a certain sorting criterion. The order of insertion doesn’t matter.
* **Unordered Containers** - unordered collections where the only important question is if a specific element is in the collection.

We will discuss only a few containers, feel free to research more containers that fit your purposes as you need them.

### Common Container Member Functions

Let's not hang too much on what **Member Functions** are just yet. We will be going over this in a later section. For now, let's just think of this as a regular funciton that knows how to act on the object (containers in this case) you are calling it from. There are many common container member functions that have mostly the functionality across containers. The link below is a great resource on all of the containers and their members. You will be responsible for knowing how to find this information and implementing it if needed. Let's touch quickly on some of the more popular ones so that you know they exist. Please note that not all member functions work for all containers. Furthermore, not all member functions are implemented the same across containers. 

We will specifically be touching on many of these and those not listed... as we continue through the course. 

#### [Containers](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)

#### Keep These in Mind:

* **begin** - returns a itterator pointing to the first element
* **end** - returns a itterator pointing to the last element
* **size** - returns the number of elements
* **empty** - returns whether the container is empty
* **resize** - resizes the container to _n_ size
* **front** - returns a reference to the first element
* **back** - returns a reference to the last element
* **at** - returns a reference to the element at the n position
* **[ ]** - returns a reference to the element at the n position
* **emplace** - container is extended by inserting a new element at position
* **insert** - the container is extended by inserting new elements before the element at the specified position
* **erase** - removes from the container either a single element (position) or a range of elements ([first,last)).
* **emplace_back** - inserts a new element at the end of the container, right after its current last element. 
* **push_back** - adds a new element at the end of the container, after its current last element. 
* **pop_back** - removes the last element in the container, effectively reducing the container size by one.
* **push_front** - inserts a new element at the beginning of the deque container, right before its current first element. 
* **pop_front** - removes the first element in the deque container, effectively reducing its size by one.
* **emplace_front** - inserts a new element at the beginning of the deque, right before its current first element.
* **clear** - Removes all elements from the deque (which are destroyed), leaving the container with a size of 0.
* **swap** - Exchanges the content of the container by the content of x, which is another deque object containing elements of the same type. Sizes may differ.
* **splice** - Transfers elements from x into the container, inserting them at position.
* **remove** - Removes from the container all the elements that compare equal to val.
* **sort** - Sorts the elements in the list, altering their position within the container.
* **reverse** - Reverses the order of the elements in the list container.
* **unique**: 
    * The version with no parameters (1), removes all but the first element from every consecutive group of equal elements in the container.
    * The second version (2), takes as argument a specific comparison function that determine the _"uniqueness"_ of an element. In fact, any behavior can be implemented (and not only an equality comparison), but notice that the function will call binary_pred(*i,*(i-1)) for all pairs of elements (where i is an iterator to an element, starting from the second) and remove i from the list if the predicate returns true.
    * The elements are removed and destoryed

##### NOTE: Many of the quick practice labs will require you implementing functionality you do not understand yet. That's okay, either research it or copy and paste it from the example code.
