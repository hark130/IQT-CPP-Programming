# Resource Management

---

### Remember Resource Management in C?

* It wasn't nice and easy
* We needed things like
  * Nested if statements
  * goto statements? \(we didn't teach you those for a reason\)
  * do - while\(0\) - break

```c
file = ifstream("README.txt");
if (file.is_open()) {
    memory = malloc(...);
    if (memory != NULL) {
        //somestuff
    }
}
memory = malloc(...)
if (memory == NULL) {
    goto cleanup;
}

cleanup:
//cleans up stuffs here
```

```c
do
{
    file = ifstream("README.txt");
    if(!file.is_open())
    {
        break;
    }
    
    memory = malloc(...);
    if(memory == NULL_
    {
        break;
    } while(0);
```

### Resource Management in C++

* C++ is much improved in the area of resource management
* C++ ties a class to a resource, so resource acquisition/release is tied to an object's lifecycle
* This is the **Resource Allocation is Initialization \(RAII\) paradigm**
* Describe what happens to **file\_ptr** in the example

```cpp
class File {
public:
    File(const string &file_name, const string &mode) {
        file_ptr = fopen(file_name.c_str(), mode.c_str());
    }
        
    ~File() {
        fclose(raw_file);
    }
private:
    FILE* file_ptr;
};
```
