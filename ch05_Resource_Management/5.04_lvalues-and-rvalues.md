# lvalues and rvalues

---

* lvalues and rvalues are a very deep subject, and we will scratch only the surface
* This is new to **C++11**
* The && symbol \(in this context\) is known as the **universal reference**
* A universal reference is a reference **T&&,** where T is a **deduced** template parameter
* Keep the below in mind as we continue through this lesson:

```cpp
class Foo {
    // default/parameterized constructors
    Foo();
    Foo(const string &a);

    // Copy constructors
    Foo(const Foo& other);
    Foo& operator=(const Foo& other);

    // Move constructors
    Foo(Foo&& other);
    Foo& operator=(Foo&& other);
}
```

* Every C++ expression is either an lvalue, or an rvalue
* **lvalues** are objects that persist beyond a single expression. They are objects that have names... but most generically they are objects that can appear on the left or right hand side of an assignment
* **r-values** are temporary values that do not persist beyond the expression that it is used for. But most generically they are objects that can only appear on the right hand size of an assignment. [^1]

```cpp
auto x = 100;

my_func(x);        // x is an lvalue
my_func(200);      // 200 is an rvalue

int a = 100;
int b = 200;

a = b;            // a and b are lvalues
a = a * b;        // and and b are lvalues

int c = a * b;    // rvalue on the right hand side
a * b = 100;      // error, rvalue on the left hand side

//Explain why?
```

* An **l-value** is an expression that refers to a memory location  and we can access that location via the & operator. This is the norm to us. 
* Whereas the rvalue is an expression that is simply not an lvalue. 

```cpp
int foobar(); // Let's assume this function is built
int j = foobar(); // foobar() is an rvalue
int* p2 = &foobar(); // error, cannot take the address of an rvalue
```

* **r-value**references are declared like "normal" references \(now known as **l-value references\)** except you use two ampersands && instead of one. 
  * This will assist us when doing the example below
* We can turn **l-values** to **r-values** with **std::move,** but be careful

```cpp
void func(Foo &&rvalue);

Foo a(100);
func(a);        // Bad. Won't compile. Why?
func(Foo(200)); // A-OK
func(std::move(a));  // OK
```

* Explain what is going on here
* Why do we copy from **l-values** but **move** form **r-values?**

```cpp
// Copy constructors
Foo(const Foo& other);
Foo& operator=(const Foo& other);

// Move constructors
Foo(Foo&& other);
Foo& operator=(Foo&& other);
```

### Local Scope and Resources

* Compare how File manages resources in these two examples

```cpp
void func(File &f);

void example1() {
    File x("foo", "w+");
    func(x);
    x.write("OOP is fun!");
    // ....
    // File is acquired here
    // ...
}   // file released here
```

```cpp
void func(File &&f);

void example2() {
    func(File("foo", "w+")); // file released before function returns
    
    //...
    // file has been released
    //
}
```
