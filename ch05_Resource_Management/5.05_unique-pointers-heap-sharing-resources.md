# Unique Pointers

---

### Unique Pointers Again...

* Using scope to manage resource is a good design pattern, but it has only worked so far for stack-allocated resources. \(Why is this?\)
* But what about heap-allocated objects?
* **Unique Pointers** are the answer. 

### Heap-allocated, scope managed

* Treat the unique pointer like any old pointer, but when it is destructed as it goes out of scope, it calls the object it points to's destructor
* Unique pointers are only able to be moved, not copied
* std::make\_unique constructs an object of type T and wraps it in a std::unique[^1]
* Because of this, unique pointers can also be called **smart pointers**

```cpp
void func(const File &f);

void example() {
    auto my_file = make_unique<File>("hello.txt", "w+");
    func(*my_file);
}
```

### Sharing a Resource with Multiple Consumers

* So what happens if you want to share a resource with multiple consumers?
* You can use a **shared pointer** using std::make\_shared
* Constructs an object of type T, and wraps it in a std::shared\_ptr
* Shared pointers are another type of **smart pointer**, but retains shared ownership of an object
* **Shared pointers** call their destructor when the last pointer to the object is destoryed

```cpp
class Consumer {
public:
    Consumer(shared_ptr<File> f): f(f) {}
private:
    shared_ptr<File> f;
}

void example() {
    auto my_file = make_shared<File>("Hello.txt", "w+");
    Consumer a(my_file);
    Consumer b(my_file);
    Consumer c(my_file);
    // ...
}
```
